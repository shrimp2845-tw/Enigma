#🔐 Enigma Machine Simulator
This project is a Python-based simulation of the historical Enigma machine, a cipher device famously used during World War II. The simulator emulates the core components of the original machine, including rotors, a plugboard, and a reflector, allowing users to encrypt messages using custom or randomly generated configurations.
